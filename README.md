# EXAM_SLM

This is a project which is used to convert inch to centimeter and yard to meter.

## :information_source: Core functionality

I implemented a REST based server by using Spring Boot. It is (hopefully) able to manage a stored message and is capable to:

- `set` it to a specific message
- `deliver` the message to the clients

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Trivial Stuff

- I had to change the server port from 8080 to 9090 --> http://localhost:9090/...
